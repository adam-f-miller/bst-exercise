<pre>The Challenge

Your company needs you to implement a Binary Search Tree (BST), using the language of your choice. Your solution will be utilized by several different teams throughout your organization. Initially, this BST only needs to support integers. 

Requirements

 The BST must be built from an array of integers
 DONE- Implement a method that returns the deepest nodes in the BST along with their depth
 - Implement any supporting methods needed for the solution to be useable by different teams throughout the organization

Example:
	Input: 12,11,90,82,7,9
	Output: deepest, 9; depth, 3

What we are looking for
 - Correctness - will your solution produce the desired results
 - Conciseness - does your solution balance clarity and brevity
 - Maintainability - does your code stand up to changing needs
 - Anti-patterns - does your solution avoid anti-patterns
